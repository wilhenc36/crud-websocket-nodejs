# NodeJS App with Socket.io

This is a simple CRUD web app, where you can create notes, modify or delete them and notice the changes in the other clients in real-time.

You can see the demo here: https://crud-websocket-nodejs.onrender.com/

Don't forget to install the Node packages, using

### `npm install`

And there are some scripts that can help you

### `npm run dev` to run the app on localhost:3000

### `npm run build` to create a dist of the app

### `npm start` to run the app like production
